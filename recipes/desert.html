        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>it is a decadent, rich dessert that feels airy and light 
            which makes it a great treat to have after a heavy meal.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons instant dark roast coffee</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon marsala wine</li>
            <li>¼ pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Combine egg yolks, instant dark roast coffee, marsala wine, 
                and sugar in a metal bowl and whisk together until smooth.</p></li>       
            <li><p>Place bowl in the top of a double boiler over lightly simmering 
                water. Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and drippings from 
                the whisk form ribbons on the surface that are visible for 1/2 
                second to 1 second, about 10 minutes. If you are "brave", you can 
                set the bowl directly over medium-low heat and thicken the egg 
                cream that way, but you have to be careful so you don't end up with 
                scrambled eggs. This last method is slightly faster and will take 
                about 6 to 7 minutes.</p></li>               
            <li><p>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. 
                Gradually add salt and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</p></li>               
            <li><p>Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric 
                mixer until medium-stiff peaks form. Using a spatula, fold in egg 
                yolk mixture until combined. Add half of the egg whites and fold in 
                until combined. Then fold in remaining egg whites until well combined. 
                Transfer mixture into small 4 ounce jam jars and close with lids.</p></li>               
            <li><p>Freeze for 4 hours or overnight.</p></li>
        </ol>
