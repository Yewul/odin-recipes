            <li><p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion

            <li><p>Reduce heat to medium; stir in condensed soup, milk, and Worcestershire 
                sauce. Add meatballs; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until 
                tender, 35 to 40 minutes.</p></li>               
            <li><p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to 
                the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain.</p></li>               
            <li><p>Add sour cream, salt, and pepper to meatballs in sauce. Cook until 
                flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Serve meatballs over noodles.</p></li>
